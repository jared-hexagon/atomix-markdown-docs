# Rules

## General

### English (US)

Use English (US) for all spelling.

### "we"

Whenever an instruction is given, use "we". ie. "We are going to instruct you on how to do things". This is to be consistent.

### List pre-requisites

If you are writing a tutorial and you assume or require something first, list all of the pre-requisites at the top with links to download them.

## Formatting

### Embed images

Include images alongside the Markdown file that will use it. Embed it using Markdown.

### Use colored squares to highlight

To help users identify something faster use a square with a 2px border with a color that stands out. Ensure it constrasts well.

### Use bold for important things

If something is important (eg. click the button **Do Something**) then use bold.

### Use inline code for paths

Any path on a filesystem needs inline code.

### Use language for code blocks

Always set the language for a code block unless it is a shell command.

### Always end a list item with a period

To be consistent.

### Format important notes

Any important notes should be formatted like this:

**Note:** The note

### Warnings

As above but change it to warning:

**Warning:** The warning

## Use headings and numbers for steps

Use a heading for the main step ("Step 1: My step"). Then a sub-heading for any sub-steps.

Use "1" for the main step. Then "1.1" or "1.52" for a sub-step.

## Use a "Done!" heading after all steps

Self explanatory.
