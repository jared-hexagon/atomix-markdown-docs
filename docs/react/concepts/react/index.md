# What is React?

> React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

# Why do we use React?

We try and use the most popular, useful and powerful tools when building our applications. React fits that bill.

# What about another library?

There are hundreds of alternatives out there but we want to pick a solid choice and stick with it.

# How do I use React?

In a website you need both [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) (which handles component logic) and [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) (which handles rendering components inside your browser).

## "Create React App"

We strongly recommend using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) which is a tool for quickly creating a new React app with 1 command.

Read their docs for getting started.
