# What is Hyperdrive?

Hyperdrive is the Atomix implementation and wrapper around [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

# What is WebAssembly?

> WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers â€” it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.

# Why do we use WebAssembly?

WebAssembly allows us to run native code in web browsers at near-native speeds. It enables powerful 3D rendering.

# What actually is Hyperdrive?

Hyperdrive is a collection of React components and hooks that make importing and writing WebAssembly fast and easy.

See the Hyperdrive demos atoms for examples.

# How do I use Hyperdrive?

Hyperdrive C++ modules are automatically compiled inside the Docker container when you build Atomix.
